# YoutubeEmbedder

Add the same video that the user opens to an iframe and stops the video with ads so you dont listen or view them. Embedded videos don't reproduce ads at the moment.

This feature is only implemented for the simple urls containing "/watch?v=" and "/playlist?list=". In the future I will explore other ocurrences

All support is appreciated. Thanks you!!
